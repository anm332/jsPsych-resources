# jsPsych-resources
Resources for learning and using [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/).
Rick Gilmore created this repository for use by students in PSY 525.001 in the Spring of 2020.

It contains the jsPsych (version 6.1.0) code and full working versions of the "hello world" [tutorial](https://www.jspsych.org/tutorials/hello-world/) and the simple reaction time [tutorial](https://www.jspsych.org/tutorials/rt-task/).
These tutorials come from the excellent documentation [site](https://www.jspsych.org/).
I modified the tutorial information only slightly, the biggest change being to update the version of jspsych in the `src="jspsych-6.1.0/...` calls.

Many thanks to Josh de Leeuw for creating a great tool and great documentation.
